## Extracted Rules Used
- Inquiry goal is coding precision, not free association expansion.
- Core coding triad in inquiry: location, determinant, content.
- Special score decisions must rely on literal response wording and inquiry support.
- Determinant coding must not be suggested to subject by examiner prompts.
- Z/organizational activity requires meaningful relational organization and form-based response basis.

## Trace Lines (for later audit)

- Spanish manual: line 244 - location clarity required for form quality coding.
- Spanish manual: line 246 - determinants are the most frequent inquiry problem area.

- Korean guideline: line 324-325 - inquiry checks location and determinant.
- Korean guideline: line 558-559 - special scores capture unusual verbiage/cognitive slippage.
- Korean guideline: line 1837 - blend, organizational activity, form quality are key response features.

## Immediate Application to App Docs
- Expanded multilingual special-score entries keep explicit: definition, assign/do-not-assign boundary, caution.
- Added emphasis on mutual exclusion and app-level constraints where relevant.
- Preserved evidence-first wording to minimize inference drift in AI retrieval.
